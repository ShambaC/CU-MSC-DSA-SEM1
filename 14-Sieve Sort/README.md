## Some Text
I don't think there are any implementation of Sieve Sorting available anywhere. There is supposed to be one in the second paper mentioned but I could not find it.

This is my implementation of sieve sorting. Read the paper for the algorithm. Also this script is not efficient at all. This just follows the sieve sorting algorithm.
